# React Hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef

## Introduction
React hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features without writing a class. Three essential hooks are `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. In this README, we'll explore how to use each of these hooks and their common use cases.

## useState Hook
The `useState` hook is used to add state to functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update it, much like `this.state` and `this.setState` in class components.

## useEffect Hook
The `useEffect` hook adds the ability to perform side effects in functional components. It combines the functionality of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods.

## useRef Hook
The `useRef` hook returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). It can be used to access the DOM nodes or to store any mutable value.

## Conclusion
Hooks provide a more natural way to use stateful logic and side effects in functional components. `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` are foundational hooks in React, but there are many more available to cover a wide range of use cases.

For more information, refer to the official React Hooks documentation.
